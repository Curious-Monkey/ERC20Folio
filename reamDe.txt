Very early stage prototype/play code. Likely, I won't develop it far.
App functions so far:
This app makes call to Ethereum Network through infura API and returns data:
-info on Eth network (from NetCheck.js in the components folder)
-info on the p3d/powh3d contract (Warning this is a pyramid on blockchain, literally don't touch it)

"someERC20.js" file is a template file.
"P3D.js" file is a little further delevoped example of contract. WARNING this is the ->Powh3d<- "pyramid scheme" contract on Ethereum, do not put your Eth there!
"NetCheck.js" file retuns some Ethereum blockchain info. Could be developt a little further.
"index.js" renders the P3D and NetCHeck components on the main page.
"tableStyle.css" just a simple css style sheet applied to components.

app starts with "npm start"

Original Idea was to develop a tool where users input their public Ethereum address and the app returns all ERC20 balances they might have.

after that you could start adding some more functionality:
-Trading via Uniswap
-Trading graphs and other data
-ERC20 contract interface
  -for those tokens that you stake, etc, create a simple interface to interact with their contract functions (instead of relying on their websites, have your personal front end)
